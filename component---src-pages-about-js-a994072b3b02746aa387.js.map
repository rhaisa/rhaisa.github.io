During this new challenge, I have found that a successful career in the modern days is directly related to technology.  \n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n            The tech industry was the most exciting field I could find which checks all the boxes. My enthusiasm and passion for learning are some of the reasons I have chosen to start learning to code. I started studying from home for a couple of months and then I signed up for a coding Bootcamp to sharpen my skills faster.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            During my training at the Bootcamp I experienced Tester activities, and it was love at first sight. It was the complete match between my quality assurance expertise and the career path that I was aiming for. Following the Bootcamp I started to study more about testing frameworks, and recently became a   ISTQB certified Tester.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            There are still many things to learn, but as I love learning new things everyday, I am sure this is the right path for me.\n            </p>\n           \n            <h3>SKILLS</h3>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Front end:</strong> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Accessibility, SEO,  React, Gatsby, Next.js.<br/>\n              <strong>Back end:</strong>  Node.js, JavaScript, PostgreSQL and SQL fundamentals.<br/>\n              <strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Git, GitHub, Heroku and VS Code.\n            </p>\n            <h3>CURRENTLY LEARNING</h3>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Testing Tools:</strong> Tosca and Selenium<br/>\n              <strong>Project Management Tools:</strong> Confluence and Jira<br/>\n              <strong>Testings Frameworks:</strong> Robot Framework and Cypress<br/>\n              <strong>Agile:</strong> Scrum, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)<br/>\n            </p>\n              \n          \n           \n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
