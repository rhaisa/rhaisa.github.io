              I have a business dregree and more than 10 years experience with
              quality assurance. Although I love the business field I needed a
              carrer that fix in my life style. After I got married I moved to
              different countrys a couple times, and every time that I change
              countrys, I need to start my carrer from scratch.

              I would like to have "A universal job" that is independent from
              language, legal or social aspects of the country I'm in. My
              enthusiasm and passion for learning is one of the reason I choose
              start learning code.
              {/* Even though I had a lot of experience and it was very good at my job. */}

              After we have settled in Vienna I decided that was the time to
              pursue my new carrer. I started studying from home for couple of
              months and them I took party of a bootcamp. So could sharpen my
              skills faster.
