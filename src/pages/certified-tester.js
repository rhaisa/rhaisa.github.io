        After my graduation at the Web Development Bootcamp, I started to study more about testing tools, techniques and frameworks. I recently got a ISTQB certification to improve my Software Quality Assurance skills. The certification covers everything from Agile testing to security testing. Preparing myself for the certification was a challenge, but at the same super fun. This decision assured me that I have chosen the right career path.

        I was so excited about all the interesting things I have learned during this time that after getting certified, I started to dive deeper into the most used testing frameworks and tools currently used.
